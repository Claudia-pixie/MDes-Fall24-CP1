            <p>  
                In a previous program, I took an HTML/CSS course and didn’t quite understand why a designer needed to learn it. But once I started working, I realized knowing how to code is super important for UI/UX designers. It helps us create functional and aesthetic designs that actually work in the real world. Also, it makes working with engineers way easier since you’re speaking their language and can bring ideas to life more smoothly.

                Quote2: "A graphic designer is someone who communicates a piece of content in shape and color."
            </h3>
            
            <p>  
            I think this expression is very straightforward. To me, graphic design is more about visual communication. It's fascinating to see how different graphic designers express the same idea in various ways. This also reminds me that, as I transition from being a graphic designer to an interactive designer, I hope to prioritize the UX logic flow over visuals.

            <p>  
                Motion and animation have always attracted me. I believe they help create more engaging and immersive experiences, enhancing the user's emotional connection to the product and making the interaction more enjoyable and memorable.

                What do Prototypes Prototype?    
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Quote1: "Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions."
            </h3>
            <p>  
                I’ve encountered some designers who believe that having a great idea is the most important part, regardless of the final prototype outcome. However, I’ve always doubted this view. In my opinion, if the prototype doesn’t fully express the original idea accurately, users might not grasp it. If an idea isn’t perfectly executed through the prototype, it remains just an idea and never truly becomes reality.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Quote2: "Selecting the focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design questions. If the artifact is to provide new functionality for users—and thus play a new role in their lives—the most important questions may concern exactly what that role should be and what features are needed to support it."
            </h3>
            <p>  
                This is a very interesting point. We often think of a prototype as a final result, but perhaps a prototype can also be a tool for strategic decision-making or helping us identify what matters most. Thinking about selecting a prototype’s focus is about recognizing which questions have the greatest impact on user experience or product functionality. It has provided me with a new perspective.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Quote3: "A rough hand-drawn prototype would not have made the idea seem real to the broad audience the video addressed: high resolution was necessary to help people concretely visualize the design."
            </h3>
            <p>  
                I find it really interesting how the level of prototype detail is connected to the audience's familiarity with design.  A more polished prototype can make abstract concepts easier for a broader audience to understand. For example, people unfamiliar with design might struggle with low-fidelity, hand-drawn prototypes because they don’t make the idea feel tangible enough. High-resolution prototypes, like polished videos, help make abstract ideas concrete, allowing the audience to better visualize how the product would work in reality.
