            Problem: How to scale the pattern like a "breathing" effect?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I created a pattern that has different colors of circles based on the x and y positions. I wanted to animate
            the size changing of each circle, like a breathing effect.
            <br>
            <br>
            To animate anything, I needed a change based on time. After going through the reference I found a variable
            called frameCount that gives me a count of how many frames have been drawn. The most interesting part is to
            figure out how to scale within a certain range, like 80% to 120% of size. After some Googling, I found out
            that I can use the sin() function to make any number yield between -1 and 1(a good reminder of middle school
            math). In order to achieve 0.8-1.2, I just needed to multiply the result by 0.2 and plus 1.
            <br>
            <br>
            By doing this, I can make all circles to scale by frameCount. However, all the circles are scaling up and
            down at them same time. It does make the breathing effect but I wanted to add some pattern in changing. I
            first tried to make the scale change by each circleâ€™s position, so I included x and y values in the
            sinusoidal calculation, by simply adding x and y. This yields in scaling changing from the top left circle
            to the bottom right circle. sin(frameCount/60 + x + y) * 0.2 + 1. But I wanted to make it something more
            interesting. After some searching, I decided to use the distance of each circle to the center of the canvas,
            which yielded an effect that changed circles by distance to the center.
